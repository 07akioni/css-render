# Something I Can't Solve
## en-US
1. Some lines are not covered after run `npm run test`. Most of coverage works very well. However, the uncovered lines are unreasonable because most of them should be covered when I look at them... I'd appreciate it if you can help me solve the problem (I'll at least offer you a cup coffee 😂🙏).

1. 在运行 `npm run test` 之后有一些行没有被覆盖。大部分覆盖看起来都没啥问题。但是，有一些没覆盖的行就莫名其妙，我看了里面好几个地方都觉得应该会运行到的。如果你能帮忙解决一下这个问题的话我会不胜感激（至少请你一杯咖啡😂🙏）。
